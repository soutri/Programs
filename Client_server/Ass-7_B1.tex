\section*{Aim}
8-Queens Matrix is Stored using JSON/XML having first Queen placed, use back-tracking to place remaining Queens to generate final 8-queen's Matrix using Python. Create a backtracking scenario and
use HPC architecture (Preferably BBB) for computation of next placement of a queen.

\section*{Theory}
\subsection*{N-Queens Problem}
The eight queens problem is the problem of placing eight queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that none of them attack one another (no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal). More generally, the n queens problem places n queens on an n×n chessboard. \\
\subsection*{PsuedoCode}

SolveQueens (Integer boardSize, Queequeen[boardSize]);//
i $\leftarrow$ 0 \\//Begin by placing the queen number 0 \\
while i $\le$  boardSize \\
	queen[i].row <- queen[i].row + 1\\
		//Place queen[i] to next row
	/* If queen[i] exceeds the row count, reset the queen and 
		re-place queen[i-1] \\

	if(queen[i].row $\ge$ boardSize) \\
		queen[i] $\leftarrow$ -1; \\
		i $\leftarrow$ i - 1; \\
	else \\
		//While the queen[i] is under attack move it down the row \\
		while(isUnderAttack(queen[i]) \\
			queen[i].row <- queen[i] + 1; \\
		//if queen[i] exceeds the row count, reset it, re-place queen[i-1] \\
\noindent if(queen[i].row >= boardSize) \\
			queen[i].row $\leftarrow$ -1 \\
			i $\leftarrow$ i - 1; \\
		else \\
			i++; \\
end while \\
		
\subsection*{Backtracking Algorithmic Stratergy}
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that c cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.\\
The classic textbook example of the use of backtracking is the eight queens puzzle, that asks for all arrangements of eight chess queens on a standard chessboard so that no queen attacks any other. In the common backtracking approach, the partial candidates are arrangements of k queens in the first k rows of the board, all in different rows and columns. Any partial solution that contains two mutually attacking queens can be abandoned.\\
Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a "partial candidate solution" and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution. It is useless, for example, for locating a given value in an unordered table. When it is applicable, however, backtracking is often much faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate a large number of candidates with a single test.\\
Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is often the most convenient (if not the most efficient technique for parsing, for the knapsack problem and other combinatorial optimization problems.
